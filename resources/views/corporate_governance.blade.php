                            <p class="paragraph">Globalization has not only significantly heightened business
                                risks, but has also compelled Indian companies to adopt
                                international norms of transparency and good governance. Business today is no
                                longer just about the bottom line. A
                                company is now more than the sum of its quantifiable parts: without a deeply
                                ingrained set of core values and a
                                humanistic outlook, a strong balance sheet alone does not guarantee a companyâ€™s
                                success. At Century Real Estate, our
                                governance policy recognizes the challenge of this new business reality in
                                India.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">Although we are a privately held Company, good governance
                                underpins our every action and decision. Because we understand
                                the value of the long-term view, and our solid history goes to proves this.
                                Rather than settling for instant gains at
                                any cost, we foster an atmosphere of credibility, trust and transparency. It is
                                no great achievement to merely comply
                                with the letter of the law; by going further than the mandatory and embracing
                                the voluntary, we strive to create genuine
                                wealth. While this value generation may begin in the workplace, it extends to
                                all our stakeholders. By investing the
                                Company with a social conscience, our customers, employees, investors and
                                partners all benefit from increased
                                accountability, a sense of fair play and commitment to the larger community.</p>
